Specifically, I would like to explore the connection between people's perceived health and their accessibility to a family doctor and them receiving a flu shot. Further, I would like to produce a map of people having access to a healthcare provider for Canada, as well as people receiving flu shots, so we can extrapolate to the country on whether having these two factors would be helpful in improving perceived health."
